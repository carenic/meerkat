//! Public ownership of a running mob and the Closing admission state (D67).
//!
//! Every exported [`MobHandle`](super::MobHandle) clone carries one shared
//! public-owner token. The actor's own clones (flow executor, event pumps,
//! recovery drivers, member tools) and read-only views do not, so they never
//! keep a mob open for its owners. A foreground operation started on behalf
//! of an owner can take a lease of its own with `acquire_owner`, from any
//! handle, while admission is open.
//!
//! When the last owner (token or lease) drops, the actor observes the release
//! on its serialized loop and closes admission as soon as the mob is idle. An
//! explicit `close_if_idle` and an unconditional `close_admission` enter the
//! same Closing state. Owner presence and the close are decided together under
//! one lock ([`MobOwnership`]), so an owner acquired before an idle close
//! keeps that close from closing (an unconditional `close_admission` closes
//! with owners and admitted work present, by design) and an acquisition after
//! any close is refused. Closing never stops
//! admitted work: the ordinary Stop, Shutdown and Destroy remain the teardown
//! path. An admitted Shutdown closes admission itself, before its teardown;
//! so do an admitted Destroy, a durability fail-stop and a dispatch failure
//! that stops the actor, and a lost actor task closes it from its spawn
//! wrapper, so no actor exit leaves admission open. A Stop leaves it open.
