//! The per-session mutation gate (M) and the only ways to wait for it.
//!
//! M serializes same-session mutating commands across the full DSL-stage ->
//! driver-mutate -> DSL-sync span. Without it, two concurrent commands on the
//! same session can interleave between the DSL projection sync (which
//! releases the `sessions` lock) and the driver mutation (which takes the
//! `driver` lock on its own). It is not a replacement for either lock: it is
//! an additional serialization point that spans the whole multi-step window.
//!
//! Every copy of M is a [`SessionMutationGate`]: the session entry's, an
//! unregister saga's incarnation witness, a member residency's registration
//! and effect lease, a registration witness's weak copy, and any gate a
//! command captured before it waited. The mutex is private, so whoever holds
//! a copy takes the gate in one of three named ways:
//!
//! - [`SessionMutationGate::lock_live`], for work on a live session. Once the
//!   session degrades while another holder keeps the gate, the wait ends with
//!   the degradation's cause. The holder may be one that keeps the gate until
//!   the session is reloaded, such as the post-stop fence an exited runtime
//!   loop retains after a failed boundary commit.
//! - [`SessionMutationGate::lock_settled`], which waits as long as the holder
//!   keeps the gate. Its caller names why that is right with a
//!   [`SettledGateWait`].
//! - [`SessionMutationGate::try_lock`], which never waits.
