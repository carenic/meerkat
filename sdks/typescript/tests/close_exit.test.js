/**
 * `close()` leaves nothing behind that keeps the Node process alive, and a
 * child that exits by itself fails the requests waiting on it.
 *
 * `close()` ends the child's stdin, signals it, and waits for it to exit, up
 * to 5 s before it escalates to SIGKILL. A timer left running after the child
 * exited first kept every caller's process alive for those 5 s. Waiting for
 * the child's pipes to close instead of its exit let a descendant that holds
 * them keep `close()` waiting for the whole 5 s, or for ever after the kill.
 *
 * A child that exits by itself, a crash for instance, fails the pending
 * requests once its pipes have closed, so the error carries its whole stderr.
 * A descendant holding those pipes left the pending requests, and every
 * request sent after the exit, waiting for ever.
